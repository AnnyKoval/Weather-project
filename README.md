# Weather-project
SheCodes Plus workshop. 

This is my first interactive project being a student in a front-end development course, finishing a SheCodes Plus. In this project was used not only CSS and HTML, I also engaged JavaScript and API. 
In this weather application main attention payed to made the weather forecast current and precise. This task was reached using the API openweathermap.org.
